This addon integrates Organize Series with the All In One SEO pack by Michael Torbert.

== Description ==
With this add on you will tap into the great Search Engine Optimization provided by AIO SEO, which in turn helps to improve the search engine referrals to your website.  Note, that out of the box, the concept of \"series\" is already a great traffic driver and Organize Series helps make it easier for you to naturally attract more readers.  However, this add-on takes things \"up a notch\" in giving you finer control over series archive page titles,  adding the series description to the meta description field in the header of series archive pages, toggling no-index/no-follow on or off to prevent duplicate content, and even automatically adding the series title to the keywords of a displayed post.

== Installation ==
This add-on requires Organize Series Core to be installed and active.

1. MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP YOUR WORDPRESS DATABASE (that\'s all in caps for a reason - nothing *should* go wrong but it\'s a good precaution nevertheless!!)
1. Download the File (or use the built-in updater provided by WordPress)
1. Extract to a folder in `../wp-content/plugins/`. The orgSeries folder can be named whatever you want but the default is \"organize-series-aio-seo\".  The final structure would be something like this: `../wp-content/plugins/organize-series-aio-seo/--and all the plugin files/folders--`
1. Activate the plugin on your WordPress plugins page.

You can do the above or just use the new plugin install integrated in WordPress.
